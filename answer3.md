## Question I'm currently trying to validate some inputs in Express using express-validator. I know that it's typical to pass it as a separate middleware into the route, but I needed access to the res object, so I had to write it in the way you see below.
The part that I'm struggling with is the custom validator. I'd like it to call an asynchronous function store.todoListTitleExists(title) that queries a database and checks if a title already exists. If the title doesn't exist, my intention is to save an error message which I can later display as a flash message.
Currently, this code doesn't work. I've looked through the documentation but I can't seem to figure out how to make this custom validator + error message work properly since it calls an asynchronous function. Any help would be apprecated.
Thanks! ##
